### Report
For encryption, we used a slightly more complicated scheme. Instead of only being able to encode and decode english 
letters we can support all 2^16 - 1 `char`s. The underlying algorithm is basically the same.

In TestClarkData we created some files in `/tmp`. Depending on your system this may not work for you.

A digital computer can usually be regarded as consisting of three parts: (i) Store. (ii) Executive unit. (iii) Control. ...The executive unit is the part which carries out the various individual operations involved in a calculation. ...It is the duty of the control to see that...[the table of] instructions are obeyed correctly and in the right order. ...A typical instruction might sayâ€”"Add the number stored in position 6809 to that in 4302 and put the result back into the latter storage position." Needless to say it would not occur in the machine expressed in English. It would more likely be coded in a form such as 6809430217. Here 17 says which of various possible operations [add] is to be performed on the two numbers. ...It will be noticed that the instruction takes up 10 digits and so forms one packet of information...

In ClarkData.java we got permission from Natasha to use `static` for `encrypt` and `decrypt`.

> In your test classes, what happens if you provide a negative value for a port
number, or a null value for a user? How do you think you can fix these issues?

There is nothing that immediately breaks when inserting these edge case into our classes. 
However, as the project progresses and more things start functioning we would start running into issues.
For example a negative value for a port would crash our program because ports must be between 1 and 65535.
If we asked the operating system for port `-30` it would likely just refuse our request or if 
for some reason it did allocate a port it would be something unexpected.

A bad solution is to "just write good code" and "trust the user". These solutions won't work in a production 
environment. A general solution to all of these types of problems is to check for these edge cases and raise exceptions
whenever they are reached.
